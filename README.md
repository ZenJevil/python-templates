Simple Python framework for creating code templates that you can use to make writing code faster and more efficient.
Supports every programming language, runnable on any system, and is quick and easy to use.

## Installation

1. Go to the latest [release](https://github.com/ZenJevil/python-templates/releases/latest) and download the .zip file.

2. Extract the zip file in any directory you would like.

3. Go to your command line, and type ```python3 templates.py ./starter-templates/[template file] [file extension]``` (make sure you are in that directory)

4. (Optional) Rename your file to anything else while still keeping the file extension.

## Creating a template

1. Create a new ```.template``` file and place it in the ```starter-templates```, or any other directory that you can access.

2. Write your code in the template file as if it was a normal file (it is suggested you make your code in an actual file before to check syntax errors, then paste it into the template file)

3. Run the command ```python3 templates.py ./starter-templates/[your file name] [file extension]```

4. (Optional) Rename your file to anything else while still keeping the file extension.


# And just like that, you have a simple template that you can use whenever you like!

## Note: if you are unable to set the file extension, make sure you do NOT include the '.' in the file extension, only the letters, such as 'c', not '.c'

## Note 2: also make sure that your template is in the ```starter-templates``` directory lol
